# First Code Challange - Alpha EdTech (24/04)

## The challange

Develop a web version of the classic [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) game, released in Brazil as Genius.
Client-side only. Developed using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements (assigned by course instructor)

* Authorial code. Allowed to use references from other developers' codes, however 
all classes, methods and event controls should be developed by the team;

* Elaborate and intuitive interface. When a player presses a color, it flashes and the
respective sound plays; the score must be visible; specific lights and sound when the
player loses; other UX aspects;

* Use a 'Time' class, developed in a previous module of the course, to control the interval
between flashes and sounds that show the sequence to be followed. The higher the sequence,
the shorter the interval;

* Use a 'Simon' class to randomly create the sequence and methods to control the game.

* Allow player to register keyboard keys for each clickable game button;

* Settable timeout for player to click on a button, triggering a game over callback if the time
runs out;

* Replay button to repeat the last sequence after player loses.

## Code insufficiencies

1. Object Orientation.
2. Refactoring.

## Future interface and playability implementations

1. Color blind mode (customizable color palette) and blind mode (colors are spoken instead of flashed) 
2. Help menu remodeling.
3. Ranking with names and scores.

## Version 2

We are working on a [new and improved Simon game](https://github.com/jpgsaraceni/genius-frontend), built with React, ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL.
