## üéØ The challange
</br>

Develop a web version of the classic [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) game, released in Brazil as Genius.
Client-side only. Developed using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
</br>
</br>

## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements (assigned by course instructor)
</br>

* Authorial code. Allowed to use references from other developers' codes, however 
all classes, methods and event controls should be developed by the team;

* Elaborate and intuitive interface. When a player presses a color, it flashes and the
respective sound plays; the score must be visible; specific lights and sound when the
player loses; other UX aspects;

* Use a 'Time' class, developed in a previous module of the course, to control the interval
between flashes and sounds that show the sequence to be followed. The higher the sequence,
the shorter the interval;

* Use a 'Simon' class to randomly create the sequence and methods to control the game.

* Allow player to register keyboard keys for each clickable game button;

* Settable timeout for player to click on a button, triggering a game over callback if the time
runs out;

* Replay button to repeat the last sequence after player loses.
</br>

## :thumbsdown: Code insufficiencies
</br>

1. Object Orientation.
2. Refactoring.
</br>

## üî∞ Future interface and playability implementations
</br>

1. Color blind mode (customizable color palette) and blind mode (colors are spoken instead of flashed) 
2. Help menu remodeling.
3. Ranking with names and scores.
</br>

## üö© Version 2
</br>

We are working on a [new and improved Simon game](https://github.com/jpgsaraceni/genius-frontend), built with React, ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL.
